Line 1 - 16
The smallest number I could have seen is 5 and the largest number I could have seen is 20.

Line 2 - 9
The smallest number I could have seen is 3 and the largest number I could have seen is 9.

Line 3 - 2.8201304330660664
The smallest number I could have seen is 2.5 and the largest number I could have seen is 5.5.
